# openAFM

for completion also is required : 
- stm32f373 dev board ( I used STM32F373C8T6 board). External DAC for next iterations for better performance is required ( STM32F373 has 16-bit ADC but 12-bit DAC)
- DDS module for preamplifer (I used AD9833 board, also tested AD9850, both works fine). Both are rather expensive IC's but cheap module can be found on aliexpress or equivalent ( they work reasonably well)
- CD4046 board for PLL ( currently on breadboard, design and PCB will be released )
